{"_id":"6HUKvzXaXDEU7s4r","name":"Pnoll","type":"ancestry","img":"modules/pf2e-expansion-pack/icons/direwolf.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>The sound of padding paws in the night, a tree branch creaking under weight, the snuffling nose in the rubbish heap-these are signs that a pnoll is near. Pnolls are hardy, resourceful, clever, and a bit hapless; they generally like to avoid attention, preferring instead to just do their own thing. Nomadic and nocturnal, they travel through settlements under the moonlight, collecting useful refuse.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Because pnolls keep to themselves and typically move about only at night, not many other people even know about them. Their independence means they rarely form long-term bonds, but they're agreeable and easygoing enough to be excellent companions... most of the time. They tend to have great patience for most things, but a few pet peeves make them swiftly turn grumpy. These usually have to deal with someone intruding upon their personal space, chiding them for their hygiene, being wasteful, or talking incessantly.</p>\n<p>Though they do have qualities suited for the adventuring life, they seldom waddle into danger voluntarily. Danger and conflict are exhausting and best avoided, they believe. However, most pnolls have good hearts, and may find themselves pulled into fraught situations, despite their better judgment.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is independent, down-to-earth, odd, occasionally cantankerous, and a little gross, you should play a pnoll.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide helpful, practical life advice, sometimes sounding like an overbearing parent or relative.</li>\n<li>Get annoyed at others' wastefulness or greed.</li>\n<li>Quickly concede your points in a conversation or debate, preferring to keep things chill.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciate your clever and practical planning.</li>\n<li>Don't like watching you sift through trash, and encourage you to bathe. With water. And soap.</li>\n<li>Get annoyed when your nocturnal wandering and snacking wakes them in the middle of the night.</li>\n<li>Pronounce it \"nol\" instead of the proper \"PUH-nol.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stocky with wide bellies and hunched posture, most standing between 4'7\" and 5'5\". Their naked tails extend about 4\" long, and pnolls tend to either let them drag along behind them or curl them in close to the body to be inconspicuous. Pnolls are rugged and accustomed to the hardships of the road, making them particularly hardy.</p>\n<p>Every pnoll has a pouch on their abdomen, built for storing newborn joeys. A pnoll's pouch can contain around a dozen young, and feed them with teats on the interior of the pouch. Actually sustaining that many at once is a hardship for the parent, hence the pnoll saying, \"May your litter be modest.\" Pnolls living in a group might pass joeys from the parent to another carrier. The \"pouch papa\" regards this as an annoyance, but a necessary one. When not carrying young, pnolls find all sorts of other uses for this convenient pouch, such as storing food, hiding items, or warming their hands.</p>\n<p>Pnolls gestate for only a couple months before being born. Joeys spend the first few months living in their parent's pouch, until they're too heavy to carry. Pnolls reach maturity at around 7 years old and can live to 90 years or older. The aged are especially revered, even more so if they've become gnarled or scarred over their years.</p>\n<p>A pnoll's fur is thick and warm, mostly gray and white. Typically, a pnoll has some patches of black, especially around the ears, hands and feet. This fur can be quite soft, provided it's not soiled with mud or spilled food and drink.</p>\n<p>Pnolls' resemblance to opossums causes some outsiders to call them \"opossumfolk.\" Pnolls refuse to use this name on the grounds that it's too many syllables.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Pnolls happily find community where they can, but they rarely regard such occurrences as permanent. Pnolls don't have a high opinion of organized humanoid societies-they think everyone is trash. In fact, this cultural misanthropy is the closest thing pnolls have to a fundamental philosophy. This stems from a humble nature rather than disdain or cynicism, for if everyone is trash, there's no reason for anyone to act superior over another. Pnolls value trash, but they don't see any reason to elevate it. This makes them pragmatic and down-to-earth, focused primarily on survival. The rare pnoll that finds a comfortable life attributes it to good luck rather than personal worth, and shares any excess beyond what they need with their fellows. They get along well with other modest people, especially halflings, and love to share stories, meals, and a warm campfire.</p>\n<p>Pnolls don't share one monolithic culture. Most of their wisdom comes in the form of adages or parables passed down within their families. Often these stories feature some distant-likely made up-family member who learned a painful lesson through their own foolishness.</p>\n<p>Inventive and frugal, pnolls root through waste piles and trade for damaged goods that could be made functional again with simple repairs. Pnolls' sense of taste isn't strong, so they also consume old food that isn't quite spoiled. This part of the pnoll lifestyle can put them at odds with overly stringent laws of big cities. This means pnolls often stop in at a big city briefly to collect the high-quality refuse of the wasteful wealthy before traveling on to smaller communities with less waste but less uptight social structures. Some of them, though, find a place as a rag-and-bone trader, though the moment they have to deal with red tape or getting some kind of city license they usually move on rather than deal with the hassle.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Pnolls as a people have good intentions but little comprehension of laws that don't protect people from harm. This means most of them are neutral good or chaotic good.</p>\n<p>When it comes to worship, they choose what they like of a god's tenets and reject the rest. For instance, even a good pnoll might appreciate that Lamashtu is a mother who supports the downtrodden while disliking her exhortation of corruption, essentially taking one lesson away while ignoring the rest of the deity's edicts. Most people more invested in organized religion find this incomprehensible, and they don't believe the pnoll is worshipping the deity at all.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Pnoll names stay short-often just one or two syllables-with a sound that either falls, then rises or that drops flat like sputum hocked onto pavement. They tend to refer to people as \"Sam,\" a term comparable to \"buddy,\" including people whose names they don't yet know. Likewise, \"Sams\" refers to a group of people or a litter of pnolls.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Doke, Fef, Grodette, Hud, Hurba, Narnee, Umpa, Plod, Purg, Sport, Stoo, Tankle, Thoda</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["humanoid","custom"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":"pnoll"},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.661,"lastMigration":null},"hp":10,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["con"]},"1":{"value":["int"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["cha"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","custom"],"custom":"pnoll"},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["goblin","halfling","orcish","undercommon"],"custom":""},"items":{"va4uz":{"pack":"pf2e.ancestryfeatures","id":"DRtaqOHXTRtGRIUT","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/low-light-vision.webp","name":"Low-Light Vision","level":1},"3do5h":{"pack":"pf2e-expansion-pack.Expansion-Features","id":"AZUUT9C8EVVdCjIP","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/adventuring-gear/belt-pouch.webp","name":"Pouch","level":0}},"vision":"normal"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"A7Cmsw43rnggTkpf":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.EzP5nAaDaYVaoxID"}}}
{"_id":"EoGf9oVFWKqYxwCR","name":"Rabbitfolk","type":"ancestry","img":"modules/pf2e-expansion-pack/icons/rabbit-head.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>Rabbitfolk are curious people who have a knack for getting into and out of trouble. They are especially sociable and keep close friends. In combat, they use their wit and agility to maneuver around foes and avoid dangers.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Rabbitfolk are a clever people known for their ability to get out of danger using their wiles or their agility. They have an innate curiosity that can sometimes get them into trouble. They like to set out into the world to find new experiences to better understand the world and the people that inhabit it. Rabbitfolk believe that a pursuit of knowledge is helpful in their way of life and will often share the knowledge they learn with loved ones.</p>\n<p>Rabbitfolk are curious and clever humanoids that are prone to fits of exploration and discovery. Their curiosity is supported by an almost lack of social inhibitions. They have no issue or shame with asking questions that others would consider foolish or rude. Additionally, this curiosity instills a desire to seek out new experiences, a desire that can sometimes be detrimental. Most rabbitfolk have a tale of a friend or relative that ended up getting hurt or worse simply because they \"might be the first rabbit that ever did it.\"</p>\n<p>This propensity for danger is mitigated by a rabbitfolk's speed and agility. This feature, combined with their ability to quickly recognize danger, allows many rabbitfolk to elude harm, even in situations that would be dire to most others. The rabbitfolk habit of escaping danger has earned them a reputation for being thrill seekers and trouble makers.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is always wanting to learn, outgoing, and quick of wit and foot, you should play a rabbitfolk.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have an almost insatiable desire to learn.</li>\n<li>Allow your curiosity to lead you into dangerous situations.</li>\n<li>Analyze situations to put you at the greatest advantage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider you fickle and erratic.</li>\n<li>Believe that you have multiple solutions to every problem and answer to every situation.</li>\n<li>Assume you will provide unwanted facts and details, even when not prompted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Rabbitfolk are tall, lithe beings with long ears, whiskers, and short tails. Their short fur typically runs shades of white, gray, brown, and black. Most rabbitfolk stand a little more than 5 feet tall from their feet to the top of their heads. Rabbitfolk ears add some extra height, with most ears spanning a few inches in length and some ears reaching as tall as one foot. Not all rabbitfolk ears stand tall, however, and some rabbitfolk instead have ears that flop down against their head.</p>\n<p>Rabbitfolk age at a similar rate to humans, save that infant rabbitfolk can walk after only a few months. Most rabbitfolk can live to be up to 80 years of age. Thanks to their thinner frames, most rabbitfolk weigh the same as humans of similar, lean builds. Rabbitfolk clothing is typically form fitting and light to allow for the greatest range of movement, though older rabbitfolk tend toward looser clothing. Rabbitfolk forgo footwear, instead relying on their own bare feet through most terrain. These feet develop hard pads that can defend against the elements as well as any shoe.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Known to themselves as malivars, rabbitfolk are a generally sociable people. Community is central to rabbitfolk culture. Malivar settlements have fluid social dynamics where most rabbitfolk share in aspects of each other's lives. Rabbitfolk children visit and stay at other homes for extended periods of times, whether or not they have any relation. Homes will include two or three malivar families at once, each sharing in their resources. At any given time, a rabbitfolk home might have several outsiders including other rabbitfolk from the same settlement, traveling rabbitfolk, and outsiders of other ancestries. This constant intermingling reinforces cooperation among malivar communities.</p>\n<p>The common rabbitfolk curiosity pushes many rabbitfolk toward scholarly pursuits. Researchers, teachers, and chroniclers are common among rabbitfolk. Rabbitfolk tend to keep written and oral histories that contain entire generations worth of knowledge. This practice is common among rabbitfolk of all kinds, regardless of vocation. Rabbitfolk farmers keep decades of weather patterns, cooks have hundreds of recipes, and warriors keep chronicles of great battles and specific tactics.</p>\n<p>Other ancestries sometimes have trouble keeping up with malivars. A rabbitfolk's mind is constantly changing focus and keeping track of multiple lines of thought at once, which can make discussions with a rabbitfolk difficult. To a rabbitfolk, the multitude of ideas is easy enough to sort out in the moment, but to others it can feel like a chaotic mess of disparate thoughts with no obvious connections. This experience can lead many non-rabbitfolk to believe that rabbitfolk are people incapable of focusing on a single task. In reality, most rabbitfolk like to approach a given goal from multiple angles and consider several possibilities for success.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Rabbitfolk are inclined to help others and consider ways in supporting their close friends. As a result, many rabbitfolk are good. They have no particular leanings toward chaos or law, as their intermingling societies require an understanding of unwritten social rules, but these same social rules constantly bend and change as families grow and shrink. Even rabbitfolk with an affinity toward neutrality or evil have a close-knit group of allies. Rare is the rabbitfolk without friends.</p>\n<p>Due to their curiosity, many rabbitfolk worship gods of knowledge or creativity. They also worship gods of travel or luck to aid them in their journeys of discovery. Rabbitfolk focused on cooperation also tend to follow gods of aid, community, and healing.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Newborn rabbitfolk don't receive individual names. Instead, an entire litter will receive a title such as \"Warren Swarm,\" \"Little Stars,\" or \"Seedlings.\" The members of the litter learn to respond as a group to the title until they grow to be old enough to travel unsupervised within their own settlement, usually at three or four years of age. At this point, the community provides possible names to the parents based on what the individual rabbitfolk inspires among their neighbors.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the parent and child work together to choose two names, their \"life\" name and their \"warren\" name. The child chooses the life name that best fits their perception of themselves and is prone to change throughout a lifetime. The warren name is similar to a family name or surname and most parents choose the same warren name for all of their children, though a warren name might differ in cases where a rabbitfolk seems more at home with other families.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Alpo, Burrow-blade, Charrniss, Greensong, Hallind, Lightfoot, Mossfer, Nulaniss, Rontor, Snowcharm, Tallim, Youngmoon</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["humanoid","custom"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":"Rabbitfolk"},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.664,"lastMigration":null},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":30,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["dex"]},"1":{"value":["int"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["wis"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","custom"],"custom":"Rabbitfolk"},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["dwarven","elven","gnomish","halfling","sylvan","undercommon"],"custom":""},"items":{"b4m69":{"pack":"pf2e.ancestryfeatures","id":"DRtaqOHXTRtGRIUT","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/low-light-vision.webp","name":"Low-Light Vision","level":1}},"vision":"normal"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"A7Cmsw43rnggTkpf":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"zG9y8vYI2mVQ1rmq","name":"Nashi","type":"ancestry","img":"modules/pf2e-expansion-pack/icons/raccoon-head.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>Known for their ingenuity and innovative approach to problem-solving, nashi are often a welcome sight in the eyes of most species. Whether master engineers or skilled spellcasters, nashi have cultivated a reputation for excellence that makes their goods welcome in nearly every port. They are a quick-thinking and hardy folk who value hard work and creativity, but they also have a reputation for overcomplicating simple matters and they're prone to wasting countless hours recreating the wheel if left unchecked.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Nashi are short, stocky plantigrade humanoids whose body is covered in thick fur that often makes them appear stouter then they are. Although viewed as a disparaging remark by the nashi, the term \"raccoon folk\" does aptly summarize a typical nashi's appearance, as they possess furred bodies, long tails, mask-and-ring fur patterns, and nailed digits. Nashi fur patterns come in a variety of colors that resembles those of both raccoons and manguts, including shades of gray, black, brown, and tan. Nashi cannot grow hair on their heads aside from their fur coat, but often grow out and style the fur on their heads in ways not unlike those used by humans on their hair.</p>\n<p>Nashi have extremely sensitive hands and paws, a trait that is more pronounced when submerged in water. Nashi are capable of effortlessly distinguishing physical features and properties by touch, and are known to be able to accurately judge all manner of information regarding a creature's appearance save for color with nothing but a brief grazing of their fingertips. Their small bodies and dexterous fingers also make nashi adept at a number of tasks involving physical coordination and manipulation, but their true marvel is the size of their brains, which are slightly (but noticeably) larger in proportion to the rest of their bodies compared to many other humanoid species, including humans. This has led to a stereotype that all nashi are extraordinarily intelligent, and while they are certainly fast learners and quick thinkers they aren't so much so that they outshine other objectively intelligent species, such as elves or gnomes.</p>\n<h3>Life Cycle</h3>\n<p>Nashi children are born live after a gestation period of nine months, with twins being almost twice as common among nashi than most other humanoid species. At birth, newborn nashi are blind and deaf and while their tails have yet to develop their famous ringed patterns, all younglings possess their species' distinctive mask- shaped markings around their eyes from birth. A newborn nashi's ear canals after approximately three weeks following their birth, while their eyes open for the first time sometime during their second month of life. Nashi children develop physically and meet gross motor milestones at approximately the same rate as humans, albeit smaller. Young nashi are able to speak their first words around when they take their first steps, are usually capable of speaking simple sentences before their second birthday, and meet cognitive milestones at similarly accelerated rates when compared to young members of other species.</p>\n<p>Whereas other species have symbolic milestones, such as rites of passage, young nashi have very concrete milestones in the form of their darkly colored tail rings. Newborn nashi begin life with uniformly colored tails, typically in lighter tones, but as they age their famous rings develop naturally. Most nashi develop a total of four or five tail rings throughout their lifetime, with one tail ring appearing during toddlerhood, childhood, adolescence, and finally one or two during young adulthood. While it's largely coincidental that nashi tail rings tend to develop around major developmental milestones like first steps, first day of school, and others, that hasn't stopped nashi culture from developing an entire culture of symbolism around their appearances and what they mean for the child's personality and future. Some nashi even claim to be oracles able to divine an individual's future by the their tail rings, but most of these individuals are viewed as con artists trying to make a quick coin.</p>\n<p>Nashi are physically mature after approximately 18 years, after which they age at the same rate as humans, living an average of 100 years. Nashi have proportionately more asexual members of their species than humans do, but this has little bearing on the species' overall population due to the high frequency of twin births among nashi.</p>\n<h2>If You're a Nashi, You Likely...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Prefer to work with your hands, especially when it involves crafting things.</li>\n<li>Are prone to bouts of energetic excitement.</li>\n<li>Value hard work and believe that one's value as an individual is the sum of their skills and successes.</li>\n<li>Enjoy spending time practicing and refining your skills and usually have an personal hobby.</li>\n<li>Can quickly and accurately recall information.</li>\n<li>Know a great deal about a specific field of study, but have also accrued a great deal of general knowledge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are patronizing towards you and don't respect your personal space.</li>\n<li>Suspect that you use big words or complex sentences to mock them or are otherwise patronizing towards them.</li>\n<li>Expect you to be absent-minded.</li>\n<li>Believe that you like being petted and fawned over, and blame you for their behavior when you correct them.</li>\n<li>Assume that you're a mad scientist or a genius inventor who can solve any problem with grit and elbow grease.</li>\n<li>Feel intimidated by your intellect.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Physiology</h3>\n<p>Nashi are warm-blooded creatures who stand 3 feet tall and weigh a surprising 75 pounds on average. Compared to other similarly sized humanoids, nashi are surprisingly heavy, as their bones are denser to compensate for the surprising amount of muscle and girth that a typical nashi has. Their fur and tails likewise contribute to their weight, and although a nashi's tail isn't as proportionately long as a kitsune's or a mephian's, it comprises approximately 20% of the nashi's weight on its own. Nashi have beady eyes whose irises are often hidden behind their eyelids, making their eyes look completely black unless they open their eyes especially wide or are looking off to the side. They have plantigrade feet and black, stubby nails at the end of each of their fingers and toes, as well as leathery skin on the bottoms of their hands and feet covered with sensitive hairs. These hairs afford the nashi their famously accurate sense of touch and make their hands and feet so sensitive that nashi culture considers hand and foot massage to be a form of sensual massage.</p>\n<p>Nashi have slightly sharper senses of smell and taste than an average human, and their sense of touch is significantly more acute, especially on their palms and the bottom of their feet. Nashi are able to canvas an extremely detailed mental picture of the ground simply by walking over it with their bare feet, and can accurately identify most stimuli that are in direct contact with their hands by size, weight, and shape using only their sense of touch. In addition to being more precise than a human's sense of touch, a nashi's sense of touch can accurately detect stimuli as small as a single grain of pollen. As a result nashi are extremely insistent about proper hygiene, as they can sense irritants on their hands and feet that most humans wouldn't have even known existed, let alone were present on their bodies.</p>\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n<p>Nashi culture emphasizes personal agency, creativity, and hard work, and most nashi strive to include all three of these tenants in everything they do. Nashi society often places strenuous pressure on its individuals to build a lasting legacy for themselves before they die, and these demands tend to become more and more exuberant with each passing generation, as nashi society tends to look down on those who can't surpass the accomplishments of their forbearers. As a result, those who partake in nashi culture often seem frantic and constantly stressed for success.</p>\n<h3>Life</h3>\n<p>Curiosity defines nashi from the moment they open their eyes for the first time, and that same curiosity is a driving force throughout their lives. Compared to other species, nashi enroll their children in school at a young age and their curriculums focused on giving the youngling the skills they need to answer life's questions for themselves rather than rote memorization. Nashi are encouraged to dabble in a variety of topics in youth until they find a field that calls to them, be it mathematics or martial arts. Shortly after their 10th birthday, young nashi formally choose their area of study at a large social gathering known as a Celebration of Calling. Once decided, these young nashi are expected to seek out part-time apprenticeships and focus their schooling on topics related to their chosen field. While it isn't impossible for nashi to change their calling once they've formally announced it, changing one's calling is something of a social stigma among nashi and stereotypes the individual as being flaky or unable to sound judgments regarding their personal skills and expertise.</p>\n<p>While nashi have family units, they tend to be less pronounced than those of other species. While nashi families love and support one another, their culture is one of fierce independence and stiff competition and those less than ideal traits sometimes rear their ugly heads in family life too. Nashi meritocracy encourages individuals to vie for social status at any cost, and this unfortunately includes family. It is depressingly common for otherwise loving nashi families to tear themselves apart over matters of business and personal legacy should multiple family members engage in similar professions independently, so many nashi logically choose fields of study that overlap very little with those of their family members to avoid rivalry and infighting. When nashi families do focus on a shared field of study, they often do so by banding together into a literal family business or research unit with the head of the family acting as lead. While this often negates any chance of the family imploding under its own quest for social status, families that work together in this capacity often struggle to keep their work separate from their home life, which is a major reason that so many nashi prefer to walk separate paths from their families in the first place.</p>\n<h3>Architecture</h3>\n<p>Nashi architecture is ornate and intricate in appearance, often featuring a dazzling combination of metal and glass supplemented by sturdy stone foundations covered with glazed clay mosiacs. Distinctive archways cradle door frames and stained glass windows, which are typically arranged in fanciful patterns, and both interior and exterior walls are often painted in bright, striking color combinations. Nashi architects are famous for building using a variety of geographic shapes with plenty of angles in their room design; and hexagonal towers with bell-shaped or conical roofs are staples of their style. Nashi often construct their buildings with ceilings that are high by human standards, and every building is expected to have at least one resource center stocked with dozens of books and whatever reference materials that the building's owner can afford. Most buildings are outfitted with accommodations for the latest feats of nashi engineering, and renovations to make accommodations for the latest mechanical trend is commonplace among nashi with the means to do so.</p>\n<h3>Clothing</h3>\n<p>Nashi clothing appears incredibly piecemeal in terms of style and stitch work, and in most cases such eventually are accurate. As a race of innovators motivated almost entirely by the discovery of the \"next, greatest thing\", nashi fashion goes through fads not from season by season, but week to week, and fads consist of anything from colors and patterns to fundamental styles of stitch work and clothing type. Because fashion changes so quickly in nashi society, only the wealthiest nashi can truly afford to stay up to date on the latest styles and trends while the rest are left with dozens of garments that simply don't match should they try to keep up. As a result, many nashi end up trying to find specific garments that they find comfortable and pleasing, working to create individual outfits from whatever parts they happen across and combining disparate elements into an aesthetic whole. Of course, should such a style become trendy as often is the case, the parts of that piecemeal outfits could lead to the next baffling nashi fashion trend.</p>\n<h3>Communities &amp; Nations</h3>\n<p>To outsiders, nashi society is often seen as rushed and volatile due to its constituents' obsession with unrelenting progress. A meritocracy at its core, nashi strive to advance and perfect everything from technology to policy to social justice, and while this often proves a blessing to those seeking freedom from oppression or creative freedom, a distinct lack of conservative voices challenging nashi progressivism on whether proposed innovations are necessary or practical occasionally causes nashi progressives to circle backwards on policy, especially regarding issues like taxation, immigration, and foreign policy. While nashi governments are fairly persistent, individual regimes collapse regularly, with the past four generations experiencing an average of 100 government shut downs and 32 collapses during their lifetime due to overspending and political quagmires. Nashi meritocracy is similarly susceptible to political strongmen who successfully convince the public that their brand of tyranny is the most pragmatic path for the community, and their society often sees at least one such tyrant every generation or so. Recently nashi leaders have begun incorporating a council of members of other species into their cabinets as advisors, and data suggests that governments who have made this switch have record-low tumultuousness spanning decades, but fascism remains an ever-constant threat for their political future.</p>\n<h3>Language</h3>\n<p>Nashi possess their own, unique language called Nashi that has its roots in Sylvan. While Nashi as a spoken language isn't particularly noteworthy among languages, as a written language Nashi is reportedly the easiest language to learn to read and write, to the extent that its inventor once boasted that even an orc could learn the language in the span of 10 days. This is due to its intuitive design-in Nashi, syllables are written in a way that indicates how each sound is produced. Nashi names tend to be strange, neigh unpredictable combinations of traditional Nashi words and words from other languages, particularly Common.</p>\n<h3>Cuisine</h3>\n<p>Nashi cuisine reflects its culture's insistence upon innovation as opposed to invention, blending the culinary styles of dozens of different species and their ethnic groups into fusion distinctly their own. As a result, nashi communities tend to have dramatically different cooking styles from one another, as each community's cooking is informed by neighboring species. If nashi food has one defining feature, its that many of the foodstuffs that nashi use in their cooking are developed using food processing techniques that they've innovated and engineered using numerous techniques, with some dishes becoming completely lost to time as the machines once used to create them fall into obsolescence. Much as how nashi clothing styles fall into and out of fashion at a rapid pace, so too do various cooking styles and dishes. One particular dish that has persisted for nearly a century despite this is ringtail pie, a dish similar to shepherd's pie save that five different \"rings\" of meats and vegetables are arranged like rings on a tree from the pie's center to its exterior, making every bite a delightful surprise.</p>\n<h3>Relations With Others</h3>\n<p>Although they get along well with members of most other races, nashi tend to internalize erroneous conclusions about other cultures and species based on information gained from first- or even second-hand contact. This tendency is of no insult among nashi, as they hold little qualm about revising previously held facts with new information. This often isn't true for members of other species, however, and as a result nashi are prone to accidentally offending others through incorrectly drawn conclusions regarding others that range from simple mistakes to offensive slights or bizarre claims. As a result, nashi tend to get along poorly with people who offend easily.</p>\n<h3>Trade</h3>\n<p>Although nashi society boasts more scientific researchers and applied scientists than any other species' society, the majority of their population occupies more traditional trades such as carpentry and metallurgy. Whatever field they choose to enter, nashi are famous for using state of the art technologies in their field. Sometimes these innovations prove a boon and result in highly valued products. For example, nashi carpenters are noteworthy for their ergonomic designs that make many of their furniture more comfortable compared to those of other species. In other cases, nashi innovation seems different for the sake of being different. For example, nashi blacksmithes often practice their trade using electrically-charged furnaces, but since these devices don't melt or set metal any quicker than a traditional forge they're largely considered a novelty by other crafters.</p>\n<h2>Ethnic Groups</h2>\n<p>Several notable ethnic groups exist among nashi, as noted below.</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Culo:</strong> Sometimes called monochrome nashi because they predominately have fur coats in shades of gray and black, culo nashi are an adaptive people that make their home all across the world. Where other nashi ethnic groups have firmly rooted cultural identities and traditions, culo nashi tend to blend in with the cultures of their neighbors, often going out of their way to bring members of other species into their settlements in order to study their culture, traditions, and technologies, adapting what they like and discarding what they don't.</li>\n<li><strong>Syanni:</strong> Compared to the muted, earthy tones of other nashi, the bright reds and oranges of a syanni nashi's fur stands in stark contrast to that of other nashi. Preferring to live away from large urban centers in quiet, rural areas, other nashi unfairly stereotype syanni as bumpkins for choosing to abstain from other ethnic group's work-centric values, instead valuing self-care and personal fulfillment.</li>\n<li><strong>Tanukun:</strong> Possessing fur coats peppered in shades of brown, fulvous, and gray, tanukun nashi are named after tanuki, a type of magical shapeshifter. According to legend, the tanukun nashi descend from a nashi hero who saved a dying tanuki and nursed them back to health. As payment, the tanuki swore to protect the hero and their family.
