A pnoll's pouch can contain around a dozen young, and feed them with teats on the interior of the pouch. Actually sustaining that many at once is a hardship for the parent, hence the pnoll saying, \"May your litter be modest.\" Pnolls living in a group might pass joeys from the parent to another carrier.

Pnolls don't have a high opinion of organized humanoid societies-they think everyone is trash. In fact, this cultural misanthropy is the closest thing pnolls have to a fundamental philosophy. This stems from a humble nature rather than disdain or cynicism, for if everyone is trash, there's no reason for anyone to act superior over another. Pnolls value trash, but they don't see any reason to elevate it. This makes them pragmatic and down-to-earth, focused primarily on survival. The rare pnoll that finds a comfortable life attributes it to good luck rather than personal worth, and shares any excess beyond what they need with their fellows. They get along well with other modest people, especially halflings, and love to share stories, meals, and a warm campfire.</p>\n<p>Pnolls don't share one monolithic culture. Most of their wisdom comes in the form of adages or parables passed down within their families. Often these stories feature some distant-likely made up-family member who learned a painful lesson through their own foolishness.</p>\n<p>Inventive and frugal, pnolls root through waste piles and trade for damaged goods that could be made functional again with simple repairs. Pnolls' sense of taste isn't strong, so they also consume old food that isn't quite spoiled. This part of the pnoll lifestyle can put them at odds with overly stringent laws of big cities. This means pnolls often stop in at a big city briefly to collect the high-quality refuse of the wasteful wealthy before traveling on to smaller communities with less waste but less uptight social structures. Some of them, though, find a place as a rag-and-bone trader, though the moment they have to deal with red tape or getting some kind of city license they usually move on rather than deal with the hassle.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Pnolls as a people have good intentions but little comprehension of laws that don't protect people from harm. This means most of them are neutral good or chaotic good.</p>\n<p>When it comes to worship, they choose what they like of a god's tenets and reject the rest. For instance, even a good pnoll might appreciate that Lamashtu is a mother who supports the downtrodden while disliking her exhortation of corruption, essentially taking one lesson away while ignoring the rest of the deity's edicts. Most people more invested in organized religion find this incomprehensible, and they don't believe the pnoll is worshipping the deity at all.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Pnoll names stay short-often just one or two syllables-with a sound that either falls, then rises or that drops flat like sputum hocked onto pavement.
