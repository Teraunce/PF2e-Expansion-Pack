{"_id":"6HUKvzXaXDEU7s4r","name":"Pnoll","type":"ancestry","img":"modules/pf2e-expansion-pack/icons/direwolf.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>The sound of padding paws in the night, a tree branch creaking under weight, the snuffling nose in the rubbish heap-these are signs that a pnoll is near. Pnolls are hardy, resourceful, clever, and a bit hapless; they generally like to avoid attention, preferring instead to just do their own thing. Nomadic and nocturnal, they travel through settlements under the moonlight, collecting useful refuse.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Because pnolls keep to themselves and typically move about only at night, not many other people even know about them. Their independence means they rarely form long-term bonds, but they're agreeable and easygoing enough to be excellent companions... most of the time. They tend to have great patience for most things, but a few pet peeves make them swiftly turn grumpy. These usually have to deal with someone intruding upon their personal space, chiding them for their hygiene, being wasteful, or talking incessantly.</p>\n<p>Though they do have qualities suited for the adventuring life, they seldom waddle into danger voluntarily. Danger and conflict are exhausting and best avoided, they believe. However, most pnolls have good hearts, and may find themselves pulled into fraught situations, despite their better judgment.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is independent, down-to-earth, odd, occasionally cantankerous, and a little gross, you should play a pnoll.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide helpful, practical life advice, sometimes sounding like an overbearing parent or relative.</li>\n<li>Get annoyed at others' wastefulness or greed.</li>\n<li>Quickly concede your points in a conversation or debate, preferring to keep things chill.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciate your clever and practical planning.</li>\n<li>Don't like watching you sift through trash, and encourage you to bathe. With water. And soap.</li>\n<li>Get annoyed when your nocturnal wandering and snacking wakes them in the middle of the night.</li>\n<li>Pronounce it \"nol\" instead of the proper \"PUH-nol.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stocky with wide bellies and hunched posture, most standing between 4'7\" and 5'5\". Their naked tails extend about 4\" long, and pnolls tend to either let them drag along behind them or curl them in close to the body to be inconspicuous. Pnolls are rugged and accustomed to the hardships of the road, making them particularly hardy.</p>\n<p>Every pnoll has a pouch on their abdomen, built for storing newborn joeys. A pnoll's pouch can contain around a dozen young, and feed them with teats on the interior of the pouch. Actually sustaining that many at once is a hardship for the parent, hence the pnoll saying, \"May your litter be modest.\" Pnolls living in a group might pass joeys from the parent to another carrier. The \"pouch papa\" regards this as an annoyance, but a necessary one. When not carrying young, pnolls find all sorts of other uses for this convenient pouch, such as storing food, hiding items, or warming their hands.</p>\n<p>Pnolls gestate for only a couple months before being born. Joeys spend the first few months living in their parent's pouch, until they're too heavy to carry. Pnolls reach maturity at around 7 years old and can live to 90 years or older. The aged are especially revered, even more so if they've become gnarled or scarred over their years.</p>\n<p>A pnoll's fur is thick and warm, mostly gray and white. Typically, a pnoll has some patches of black, especially around the ears, hands and feet. This fur can be quite soft, provided it's not soiled with mud or spilled food and drink.</p>\n<p>Pnolls' resemblance to opossums causes some outsiders to call them \"opossumfolk.\" Pnolls refuse to use this name on the grounds that it's too many syllables.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Pnolls happily find community where they can, but they rarely regard such occurrences as permanent. Pnolls don't have a high opinion of organized humanoid societies-they think everyone is trash. In fact, this cultural misanthropy is the closest thing pnolls have to a fundamental philosophy. This stems from a humble nature rather than disdain or cynicism, for if everyone is trash, there's no reason for anyone to act superior over another. Pnolls value trash, but they don't see any reason to elevate it. This makes them pragmatic and down-to-earth, focused primarily on survival. The rare pnoll that finds a comfortable life attributes it to good luck rather than personal worth, and shares any excess beyond what they need with their fellows. They get along well with other modest people, especially halflings, and love to share stories, meals, and a warm campfire.</p>\n<p>Pnolls don't share one monolithic culture. Most of their wisdom comes in the form of adages or parables passed down within their families. Often these stories feature some distant-likely made up-family member who learned a painful lesson through their own foolishness.</p>\n<p>Inventive and frugal, pnolls root through waste piles and trade for damaged goods that could be made functional again with simple repairs. Pnolls' sense of taste isn't strong, so they also consume old food that isn't quite spoiled. This part of the pnoll lifestyle can put them at odds with overly stringent laws of big cities. This means pnolls often stop in at a big city briefly to collect the high-quality refuse of the wasteful wealthy before traveling on to smaller communities with less waste but less uptight social structures. Some of them, though, find a place as a rag-and-bone trader, though the moment they have to deal with red tape or getting some kind of city license they usually move on rather than deal with the hassle.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Pnolls as a people have good intentions but little comprehension of laws that don't protect people from harm. This means most of them are neutral good or chaotic good.</p>\n<p>When it comes to worship, they choose what they like of a god's tenets and reject the rest. For instance, even a good pnoll might appreciate that Lamashtu is a mother who supports the downtrodden while disliking her exhortation of corruption, essentially taking one lesson away while ignoring the rest of the deity's edicts. Most people more invested in organized religion find this incomprehensible, and they don't believe the pnoll is worshipping the deity at all.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Pnoll names stay short-often just one or two syllables-with a sound that either falls, then rises or that drops flat like sputum hocked onto pavement. They tend to refer to people as \"Sam,\" a term comparable to \"buddy,\" including people whose names they don't yet know. Likewise, \"Sams\" refers to a group of people or a litter of pnolls.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Doke, Fef, Grodette, Hud, Hurba, Narnee, Umpa, Plod, Purg, Sport, Stoo, Tankle, Thoda</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["humanoid","custom"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":"pnoll"},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.661,"lastMigration":null},"hp":10,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["con"]},"1":{"value":["int"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["cha"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","custom"],"custom":"pnoll"},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["goblin","halfling","orcish","undercommon"],"custom":""},"items":{"va4uz":{"pack":"pf2e.ancestryfeatures","id":"DRtaqOHXTRtGRIUT","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/low-light-vision.webp","name":"Low-Light Vision","level":1},"3do5h":{"pack":"pf2e-expansion-pack.Expansion-Features","id":"AZUUT9C8EVVdCjIP","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/adventuring-gear/belt-pouch.webp","name":"Pouch","level":0}},"vision":"normal"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"A7Cmsw43rnggTkpf":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.EzP5nAaDaYVaoxID"}}}
{"_id":"EoGf9oVFWKqYxwCR","name":"Rabbitfolk","type":"ancestry","img":"modules/pf2e-expansion-pack/icons/rabbit-head.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>Rabbitfolk are curious people who have a knack for getting into and out of trouble. They are especially sociable and keep close friends. In combat, they use their wit and agility to maneuver around foes and avoid dangers.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Rabbitfolk are a clever people known for their ability to get out of danger using their wiles or their agility. They have an innate curiosity that can sometimes get them into trouble. They like to set out into the world to find new experiences to better understand the world and the people that inhabit it. Rabbitfolk believe that a pursuit of knowledge is helpful in their way of life and will often share the knowledge they learn with loved ones.</p>\n<p>Rabbitfolk are curious and clever humanoids that are prone to fits of exploration and discovery. Their curiosity is supported by an almost lack of social inhibitions. They have no issue or shame with asking questions that others would consider foolish or rude. Additionally, this curiosity instills a desire to seek out new experiences, a desire that can sometimes be detrimental. Most rabbitfolk have a tale of a friend or relative that ended up getting hurt or worse simply because they \"might be the first rabbit that ever did it.\"</p>\n<p>This propensity for danger is mitigated by a rabbitfolk's speed and agility. This feature, combined with their ability to quickly recognize danger, allows many rabbitfolk to elude harm, even in situations that would be dire to most others. The rabbitfolk habit of escaping danger has earned them a reputation for being thrill seekers and trouble makers.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is always wanting to learn, outgoing, and quick of wit and foot, you should play a rabbitfolk.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have an almost insatiable desire to learn.</li>\n<li>Allow your curiosity to lead you into dangerous situations.</li>\n<li>Analyze situations to put you at the greatest advantage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider you fickle and erratic.</li>\n<li>Believe that you have multiple solutions to every problem and answer to every situation.</li>\n<li>Assume you will provide unwanted facts and details, even when not prompted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Rabbitfolk are tall, lithe beings with long ears, whiskers, and short tails. Their short fur typically runs shades of white, gray, brown, and black. Most rabbitfolk stand a little more than 5 feet tall from their feet to the top of their heads. Rabbitfolk ears add some extra height, with most ears spanning a few inches in length and some ears reaching as tall as one foot. Not all rabbitfolk ears stand tall, however, and some rabbitfolk instead have ears that flop down against their head.</p>\n<p>Rabbitfolk age at a similar rate to humans, save that infant rabbitfolk can walk after only a few months. Most rabbitfolk can live to be up to 80 years of age. Thanks to their thinner frames, most rabbitfolk weigh the same as humans of similar, lean builds. Rabbitfolk clothing is typically form fitting and light to allow for the greatest range of movement, though older rabbitfolk tend toward looser clothing. Rabbitfolk forgo footwear, instead relying on their own bare feet through most terrain. These feet develop hard pads that can defend against the elements as well as any shoe.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Known to themselves as malivars, rabbitfolk are a generally sociable people. Community is central to rabbitfolk culture. Malivar settlements have fluid social dynamics where most rabbitfolk share in aspects of each other's lives. Rabbitfolk children visit and stay at other homes for extended periods of times, whether or not they have any relation. Homes will include two or three malivar families at once, each sharing in their resources. At any given time, a rabbitfolk home might have several outsiders including other rabbitfolk from the same settlement, traveling rabbitfolk, and outsiders of other ancestries. This constant intermingling reinforces cooperation among malivar communities.</p>\n<p>The common rabbitfolk curiosity pushes many rabbitfolk toward scholarly pursuits. Researchers, teachers, and chroniclers are common among rabbitfolk. Rabbitfolk tend to keep written and oral histories that contain entire generations worth of knowledge. This practice is common among rabbitfolk of all kinds, regardless of vocation. Rabbitfolk farmers keep decades of weather patterns, cooks have hundreds of recipes, and warriors keep chronicles of great battles and specific tactics.</p>\n<p>Other ancestries sometimes have trouble keeping up with malivars. A rabbitfolk's mind is constantly changing focus and keeping track of multiple lines of thought at once, which can make discussions with a rabbitfolk difficult. To a rabbitfolk, the multitude of ideas is easy enough to sort out in the moment, but to others it can feel like a chaotic mess of disparate thoughts with no obvious connections. This experience can lead many non-rabbitfolk to believe that rabbitfolk are people incapable of focusing on a single task. In reality, most rabbitfolk like to approach a given goal from multiple angles and consider several possibilities for success.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Rabbitfolk are inclined to help others and consider ways in supporting their close friends. As a result, many rabbitfolk are good. They have no particular leanings toward chaos or law, as their intermingling societies require an understanding of unwritten social rules, but these same social rules constantly bend and change as families grow and shrink. Even rabbitfolk with an affinity toward neutrality or evil have a close-knit group of allies. Rare is the rabbitfolk without friends.</p>\n<p>Due to their curiosity, many rabbitfolk worship gods of knowledge or creativity. They also worship gods of travel or luck to aid them in their journeys of discovery. Rabbitfolk focused on cooperation also tend to follow gods of aid, community, and healing.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Newborn rabbitfolk don't receive individual names. Instead, an entire litter will receive a title such as \"Warren Swarm,\" \"Little Stars,\" or \"Seedlings.\" The members of the litter learn to respond as a group to the title until they grow to be old enough to travel unsupervised within their own settlement, usually at three or four years of age. At this point, the community provides possible names to the parents based on what the individual rabbitfolk inspires among their neighbors.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the parent and child work together to choose two names, their \"life\" name and their \"warren\" name. The child chooses the life name that best fits their perception of themselves and is prone to change throughout a lifetime. The warren name is similar to a family name or surname and most parents choose the same warren name for all of their children, though a warren name might differ in cases where a rabbitfolk seems more at home with other families.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Alpo, Burrow-blade, Charrniss, Greensong, Hallind, Lightfoot, Mossfer, Nulaniss, Rontor, Snowcharm, Tallim, Youngmoon</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["humanoid","custom"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":"Rabbitfolk"},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.664,"lastMigration":null},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":30,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["dex"]},"1":{"value":["int"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["wis"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","custom"],"custom":"Rabbitfolk"},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["dwarven","elven","gnomish","halfling","sylvan","undercommon"],"custom":""},"items":{"b4m69":{"pack":"pf2e.ancestryfeatures","id":"DRtaqOHXTRtGRIUT","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/low-light-vision.webp","name":"Low-Light Vision","level":1}},"vision":"normal"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"A7Cmsw43rnggTkpf":3},"flags":{}}
