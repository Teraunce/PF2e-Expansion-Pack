# PF2e Expansion Pack

This Foundry VTT module is similar to PF2e Wayfinder (https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-wayfinder) in that it is a collection of unofficial PF2e content. The goal is to collect professional and semi-professional work that is not published in Wayfinder magazine and make it available here for for free. If you are a game designer for Pathfinder 2e and want your content featured, or know a designer you would like me to contact please contact me (Tikael (He/Him)#6851 on Discord).

If you like this content please support these creators and companies by buying some of their products. If you already own them, consider making a donation to a local food bank, animal shelter, https://www.modestneeds.org/, or https://www.msf.org/.
