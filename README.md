# PF2e Expansion Pack

This Foundry VTT module is similar to PF2e Wayfinder in that it is a collection of unofficial PF2e content. The goal is to collect professional and semi-professional work that is not published in Wayfinder magazine and make it available here for for free.  If you are a game designer for Pathfinder 2e and want your content featured, or know a designer you would like me to contact please contact me (Tikael (He/Him)#6851 on Discord).

# Module Contents:

## Pnoll Ancestry by Logan Bonner
The Pnoll is a new ancestry designed by Pathfinder Lead Designer and published at Drive Through RPG by Logan Bonner Games. Logan was kind enough to give permission for his work to be distributed in this module. If you like this please go visit https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/324196/The-Pnoll-An-Ancestry and purchase the PDF to get all the excellent art and support charity.

## More Coming Soon
This is the initial (unlisted) release version of this module. More content will be added as designers give their OK for it to be featured.  I have reached out to other designers, and now we wait.
