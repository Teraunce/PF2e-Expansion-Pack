# PF2e Expansion Pack

This Foundry VTT module is similar to PF2e Wayfinder (https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-wayfinder) in that it is a collection of unofficial PF2e content. The goal is to collect professional and semi-professional work that is not published in Wayfinder magazine and make it available here for for free.  If you are a game designer for Pathfinder 2e and want your content featured, or know a designer you would like me to contact please contact me (Tikael (He/Him)#6851 on Discord).

If you like this content please support these creators and companies by buying some of their products.  If you already own them, consider making a donation to a local food bank, animal shelter, https://www.modestneeds.org/, or https://www.msf.org/.

# Module Contents:

## Pnoll Ancestry by Logan Bonner
The Pnoll is a new ancestry designed by Pathfinder Lead Designer and published at Drive Through RPG by Logan Bonner Games. Logan was kind enough to give permission for his work to be distributed in this module. If you like this please go visit https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/324196/The-Pnoll-An-Ancestry and purchase the PDF to get all the excellent art and support charity.

## Rabbitfolk Ancestry, Dragonkin Heritage, Ancestry Exemplar Feats, and Lineage Feats by Luis Loza
The Rabbitfolk is a new ancestry designed by Paizo developer Luis Loza and published by Novacat Games. Dragonkin is a versatile heritage that any ancestry can take to gain a breath weapon, flight, or even attacks of opportunity! Luis generously allowed me to add his work to the module.  Be sure to visit Luis' blog https://www.luisloza.com/blog/ to see all the other content, and visit https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/347915/Ancestries-Unleashed-Rabbitfolk to get a copy of the Rabbitfolk PDF for yourself!  Also consider supporting Luis on Patreon https://www.patreon.com/luisloza.

## Nashi Ancestry by Alexander Augunas
Nashi is a new ancestry by Everybody Games' Alexander Augunas.  Nashi are racoon or tanuki folk who specialize in crafting their own weapons, including firearms!  This release is the ancestry and its feats and heritages only, but new class options, equipment, feats, and more will be coming in a future update. So if you want to play as a gun-wielding genius racoon (and who wouldn't? Rocket is great!) then get your copy of the Files for Everybody: Nashi PDF at DriveThroughRPG (https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/284562/Files-for-Everybody-Nashi) or OpenGamingStore (https://www.opengamingstore.com/products/files-for-everybody-nashi).

## Acrobatics and Stealth Skill Feats by Dustin Knight
Dustin Knight has a series of skill feat books for Everybody Games, this first release of Everybody games content includes his work on Acrobatics and Stealth.  If you've ever wanted to surf your shield across a lake of lava, convert your fall damage into a devastating pounce, quickly conceal the dagger you just stabbed with, or smoke bomb your way out of sight these skill feats are what you want.  Get your copy of the PDFs here:
 - Files for everybody: Acrobatic Feats (https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/285878/Files-for-Everybody-Acrobatics-Feats) or (https://www.opengamingstore.com/products/files-for-everybody-acrobatics-feats)

## More Coming Soon
More content will be added as designers give their OK for it to be featured.  I have permission to release all the Everybody Games content up to September 2021, and I have reached out to other designers, and have a small backlog of content currently to add.
